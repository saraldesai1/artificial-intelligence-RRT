# artificial-intelligence-RRT
In this project I have wirten a code which created the random nodes. After creating a random node tree it finds a path through it. In this code user has three different environment to select from.
The three different environment is 100 * 100, 200 * 200, and 300 * 300. Each environment has a dirrent types of obistale in it. Algorithem make sure that the nodes doesnt go through any obsitale in it. 
Also user is allowed to put start and end point where they want to find the path from.
I also have upload pictures of the output for three different enviroment.
